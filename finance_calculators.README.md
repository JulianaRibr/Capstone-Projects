<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
## 1. Description: 

This program allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan
repayment calculator.

In summary, it is a program that combines investment and home loan calculators promotes:

**-Financial literacy:** by empowering users to make informed decisions.

**-Time-Saving:** Instead of searching for separate calculators online, users can access both functionalities in one place.

**-Customization:** The program can offer customizable inputs (i.e. interest rate), allowing users to tailor calculations to their specific scenarios.hit <enter> once
